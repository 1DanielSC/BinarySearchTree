## 1. Description

This project is an implementation of Binary Search Tree data structure in Python. 


This application is set to receive an input file consisting of sequential instructions to be executed. The instructions supported can be found at [Files](#files).


## 2. Installation
You should have [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) version installed on your computer.
